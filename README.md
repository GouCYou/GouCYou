## 👋 Hi, I'm GouC

I'm a software engineering undergraduate student from China 🇨🇳, currently studying and practicing modern software development.

Most of my course projects will be open-sourced and maintained here on GitHub. I enjoy building practical systems, exploring clean architectures, and improving projects step by step rather than just finishing assignments.

I'm also a **Minecraft server owner**, with a strong interest in Minecraft server technologies — including server performance tuning, plugin development, backend services, and infrastructure-related topics. Running a server has helped me better understand real-world problems such as system stability, scalability, and user experience.

In addition to coding and gaming, I keep an eye on technology news and trends, especially in software engineering, cloud services, and developer tooling.

Although I'm still early in my journey, my long-term goal is to grow into a capable software engineer who builds reliable, well-designed systems — and eventually become someone who can create things others genuinely enjoy and depend on.

📫 You can reach me here on GitHub.
